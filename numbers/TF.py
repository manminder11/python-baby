# booleans in python are True and False
# True is equal to 1
# False is equal to 0

# example
print(10 < 4)
# it will print False because 10 is not less than 4

# example
print(10 > 4)
# it will print True because 10 is greater than 4

# evaluate values and variables

# example
print(bool("hello"))
# it will print True because the string is not empty

# example
print(bool(0))
# it will print False because 0 is equal to False

# example
x = 10
print(bool(x))
# it will print True because x is not empty

# false values \
# The following will return False:
#
# Any string is False if it is empty.

bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})
# they all are false values
